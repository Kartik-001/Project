# A TEXT BASED SLOT MACHINE

-whereby a user will deposit a certain amount of money, we're then going to allow them to bet on either one of
many lines of the slot machine
-like one row = 1X, two rows = 2X, three rows = 3X
-add that to their balance and then allow them to continue until they want to cash out

# THINGS WE NEED TO DO IN THIS PROJECT

-we need to collect the user inputs such deposit, lines to bet, betting amount etc
-we need to add it to their balance
-we need to allow them to bet on a line or multiples lines
-we need to see if they actually got any of those lines
-we need to spin the slot machine
-we need to generate the different items in the slot machine
-we need to add whatever they won back to their balance
